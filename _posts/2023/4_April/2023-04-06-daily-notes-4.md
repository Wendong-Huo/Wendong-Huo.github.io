I continuously proclaim myself as brave, and I am proud of my courage. 

During my undergraduate studies, I succeeded in public speeches in the classroom, competitions, and class activities despite having a low profile and silent personality and never training as a public spokesman. It was my courage that supported me to fulfill these heroic undertakings. Additionally, courage also helped me in some critical moments of decision-making. 

I think my courage is deeply rooted in my childhood reading experiences. In fifth grade, I received a gift from my cousin - a book named "Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece" written by H. A. Kuhn. Unlike standard fairy tale books with the same theme, this book is entirely an academic translation. Despite the obscure language, I was utterly fascinated by that remote world's legendary characters and stories. My favorite god is Hermes, the god of commerce, traveler, thief, and husband. I always wondered how great it would be if I could have the same flying shoes! On the other hand, my favorite hero (i.e., demigod) is Heracles, who was raised to the god of Olympus after he finished his twelve outstanding achievements. The grand narrative describing gods and heroes profoundly influenced my juvenile spirit and shaped my personality.

When a person is trapped in a dilemma, courage will be the engine that drives him away from the mire.
