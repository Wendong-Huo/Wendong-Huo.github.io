I always proclaim myself as a brave person. Nevertheless, a competition held in February weakened my faith. It was held to promote the development of open-source software. The competition itself was nothing, and all we participants needed to do was just present our PowerPoints online (even didn't have to communicate face to face).

The content of my presentation has been introduced to audiences on other occasions. So, I'm pretty familiar with these contents to be reported, and there's nothing to worry about. When it came to my turn, I felt so relaxed and could hardly wait to prove the software products we developed were truly feasible, efficient, and practical. After introducing myself and the title of my speech, I suddenly felt tight in my chest, and my heart seemed to be twisted into a ball. At that moment, my tone of voice became very weak and powerless since I had to adjust the strength with which I spoke to feel more comfortable. Under this circumstance, you can imagine how terrible the speech would be (despite the fact that we finally obtained the second prize). 

As mentioned before, I wasn't nervous at all during that speech, and I can't even remember when is the last moment that I was too nervous to speak. Nevertheless, the actual effect of the speech was not satisfying. The main reason was that I had to adjust my tone to feel better. 

After this accident, I realized the importance of fitness from another perspective, i.e., courage and all other human virtues must be constructed based on a healthy and strong body. There exist deep interactions between body, soul, and mind. This is also why exercises are highlighted in so many philosophies.
