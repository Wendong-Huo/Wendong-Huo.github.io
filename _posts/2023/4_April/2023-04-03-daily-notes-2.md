I have a theory, that the development of everything has to consider three fundamental issues, i.e., the known past, the uncertain present, and the unknown future. The present, which can be naturally considered a slice of the event flow, is defined by what we are conducting now. The record of the present structures the past, and the normal vector of the slice, or simply speaking the present, points to the future. But on the other hand, what we are conducting now is constructed upon the judgment about the past and the future. Consequently, the current slice and the rest counterpart form two dual relationships, i.e., the present and the past, and the present and the future. In addition, the past and the future also form a dual relationship (the past is the past future, and the future is the future past, and these two sets can be seen as the continuation of each other).

Isn't this draft a bit Picasso-esque?
Perhaps there are some problems with the sum sign.
