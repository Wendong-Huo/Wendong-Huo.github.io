In the dota2 game, a core resource that both sides should pay close attention to is the Roshan, which provides the aegis for the first time being killed, an additional cheese for the second time, and the Blessing of Ahalim for the third time. The aegis gives the ability of rebirth to its Carrier, the cheese restores most of the blood and mena after being eaten, and the Blessing provides an extra skill according to the Ahalim's Scepter. Despite so many benefits of killing the Roshan, the critical point is to earn a second life for the most central member, which significantly improves the risk resistance and the robustness of the team operation.

The profound reason must be traced back to the primary task set in the game -- the defense of the ancients and the attack of the ancients. First, the winning side should pull down the enemies' base, defended by many towers along three roads, and the opponent would protect them. Hence, the team fight is unavoidable. A standard mode is that one side kills the core position of the opponent to break the enemies' defense and further attack the buildings. In such a context, bringing an aegis and having an extra life is naturally significant, and we can imagine that many fights would happen around the Roshan to contest for the aegis.

However, the specific situation is complicated. In many cases, the two teams have a significant disparity in strength, which means the fight around the Roshan wouldn't happen. Hence, the stronger side could take the Roshan with little disturbance. What is the wisest idea to win victory while bringing the aegis? An intuitive way is leading your partners and seeking a team fight. Indeed, it's a positive and reasonable line of thought. Once again, the situation is complex. On many occasions, the enemies want to avoid meeting the fight and retreat to their base. Here comes the so-called strategy. Under such a contradictory circumstance, experiences teach us to encircle the base, not to attack forwardly, nor to drawback to home, stay structurally. On the one hand, we have to attack the base to win, which usually creates opportunities for the enemy in the balance of power. On the other hand, the enemy would get a break if we drawback. Hence, encycling the base would cut off the enemy's income resources and further weaken them.

Abstractly speaking, when we have gained many advantages (the aegis) during competition, the most intuitive way to win is to exchange these advantages directly for victory (enemies' towers and camp). Nevertheless, the wisest and most anti-intuitive strategy is exchanging current advantages for more tremendous ones.
